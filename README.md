    |a₂  b₂|

Dx = |c₁  b₁| = c₁b₂ - c₂b₁
     |c₂  b₂|

Dy = |a₁  c₁| = a₁c₂ - a₂c₁
     |a₂  c₂|

x = Dx/D, y = Dy/D
```

### Condition for Consistency

## Chapter 2: Quadratic Equations

### Weightage Analysis
- **Average Marks**: 9.4 per year
- **Weightage**: 23.6%
- **Priority**: HIGHEST

### Important Topics (in order of importance)

#### 1. Factorization Method (4 times in 7 years)
**Most Repeated**: x² + x - 20 = 0

**Steps for Factorization**:
```
1. Write in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
2. Find two numbers whose:
   - Product = a × c
   - Sum = b
3. Split middle term using these numbers
4. Factor by grouping
5. Apply zero product rule
```

**Example**:
```
x² - 15x + 54 = 0

Find numbers: product = 54, sum = -15
Numbers: -6 and -9

x² - 6x - 9x + 54 = 0
x(x - 6) - 9(x - 6) = 0
(x - 6)(x - 9) = 0
x = 6 or x = 9
```

#### 2. Quadratic Formula Method
**Formula**: x = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a

**Example**:
```
3m² - m - 10 = 0

a = 3, b = -1, c = -10
Δ = (-1)² - 4(3)(-10) = 1 + 120 = 121

m = (1 ± √121) / 6
m = (1 ± 11) / 6

m = (1 + 11)/6 = 2 or m = (1 - 11)/6 = -10/6 = -5/3
```

#### 3. Nature of Roots (Discriminant)
**Types of Questions**:
- Finding nature of roots (2 marks)
- Finding value of k for equal roots (3 marks)
- Finding value of k for real roots (3 marks)

**Example**:
```
Find nature of roots: m² + 2m + 9 = 0

a = 1, b = 2, c = 9
Δ = 4 - 36 = -32 < 0

Roots are not real.
```

#### 4. Forming Equation from Roots
**Formula**: x² - (sum)x + (product) = 0

**Example**:
```
Roots are 2 and 5.

Sum = 7, Product = 10
Equation: x² - 7x + 10 = 0
```

### Common Mistakes
1. Not writing equation in standard form
2. Sign errors in quadratic formula
3. Forgetting to divide by 2a
4. Not simplifying roots

---

## Chapter 3: Arithmetic Progression

### Weightage Analysis
- **Average Marks**: 9.6 per year
- **Weightage**: 23.9%
- **Priority**: HIGHEST

### Important Topics (in order of importance)

#### 1. Finding nth Term (MOST REPEATED)
**Formula**: tn = a + (n-1)d

**Most Repeated Question**: Find 19th term of A.P. 7, 13, 19, 25, ...

**Solution**:
```
a = 7, d = 6
t19 = 7 + (19-1) × 6 = 7 + 108 = 115
```

#### 2. Finding Sum of n Terms
**Formula**: Sn = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]

**Example**:
```
Find S27 for A.P. with a = 6, d = 3

S27 = 27/2 [12 + 26 × 3]
    = 27/2 [12 + 78]
    = 27/2 × 90
    = 27 × 45
    = 1215
```

#### 3. Three Consecutive Terms
**Approach**: Let terms be a-d, a, a+d

**Example**:
```
Sum of three consecutive terms is 27 and product is 504.

(a-d) + a + (a+d) = 27
3a = 27
a = 9

(9-d)(9)(9+d) = 504
9(81 - d²) = 504
81 - d² = 56
d² = 25
d = ±5

Terms: 4, 9, 14 or 14, 9, 4
```

#### 4. Instalment Problems
**Approach**: Use Sn formula

**Example**:
```
Borrowed Rs. 4000, repay with interest Rs. 500 in 10 instalments.
Each instalment Rs. 10 less than previous.

Total = 4500, d = -10
S10 = 10/2 [2a + 9(-10)] = 4500
5[2a - 90] = 4500
2a - 90 = 900
2a = 990
a = 495

First = Rs. 495, Last = 495 + 9(-10) = Rs. 405
```

### Common Mistakes
1. Using wrong formula (tn vs Sn)
2. Off-by-one errors (n-1 vs n)
3. Sign errors with negative d
4. Not identifying a and d correctly

## Chapter 4: Financial Planning

### Weightage Analysis
- **Average Marks**: 6.9 per year
- **Weightage**: 17.1%
- **Priority**: MODERATE

### Important Topics (in order of importance)

#### 1. Share Market Calculations
**Basic Formulas**:
```
MV = FV + Premium (at premium)
MV = FV - Discount (at discount)
Number of shares = Investment / MV
```

**Example**:
```
FV = Rs. 100, Premium = Rs. 10
MV = 100 + 10 = Rs. 110
```

#### 2. Dividend and Rate of Return
**Formulas**:
```
Dividend per share = FV × Rate%
Total Dividend = Dividend per share × Number of shares
Rate of Return = (Total Dividend / Investment) × 100
```

**Example**:
```
150 shares of FV Rs. 100 at MV Rs. 120.
Company paid 7% dividend.

Investment = 150 × 120 = Rs. 18,000
Dividend per share = 100 × 7/100 = Rs. 7
Total Dividend = 150 × 7 = Rs. 1,050
Rate of Return = (1050/18000) × 100 = 5.83%
```

#### 3. GST Calculations
**Formulas**:
```
CGST = SGST = GST/2
Total Value = Taxable Value + GST
```

**Example**:
```
Taxable value = Rs. 500, CGST = Rs. 45, SGST = Rs. 45

Total GST = 45 + 45 = Rs. 90
GST Rate = (90/500) × 100 = 18%
```

### Common Mistakes
1. Confusing FV and MV
2. Forgetting to calculate total dividend
3. GST rate calculation errors
4. Not converting percentage to decimal

### Weightage Analysis
- **Average Marks**: 9.0 per year
- **Weightage**: 22.5%
- **Priority**: HIGH

### Important Topics (in order of importance)

#### 1. Mode Calculation
**Formula**: Mode = L + [(f₁ - f₀) / (2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h

**Steps**:
1. Identify modal class (highest frequency)
2. Find L, f₁, f₀, f₂, h
3. Substitute in formula

**Example**:
```
Class      | Frequency
0.5-3.5    | 33
3.5-6.5    | 40  <-- Modal class
6.5-9.5    | 27

L = 3.5, f₁ = 40, f₀ = 33, f₂ = 27, h = 3

Mode = 3.5 + [(40-33)/(80-33-27)] × 3
     = 3.5 + [7/20] × 3
     = 3.5 + 1.05
     = 4.55
```

#### 2. Median Calculation
**Formula**: Median = L + [(n/2 - cf) / f] × h

**Steps**:
1. Find n = total frequency
2. Find n/2
3. Identify median class (cf ≥ n/2)
4. Find L, cf, f, h
5. Substitute in formula

#### 3. Histogram
**Important Points**:
- Use pencil
- Label axes
- Mention scale
- No gaps between bars

### Common Mistakes
1. Wrong modal/median class
2. Using upper limit instead of L
3. cf calculation errors
4. Histogram scale errors
